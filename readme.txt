== Description ==

Adminyo is a powerful time-saving toolbox with some extraordinary capabilities. For a better WP Administration workflow we've integrated multiple tools that work together to help you manage your site much faster and easier.

We've developed this plugin with love and appreciation for the WP Community but we still think that there are certain functions that can be upgraded. We are also looking forward for your impressions and suggestions on how to expand Adminyo further.

= Special Features =

1.**Pin to Dashboard**- Shortcuts to Dashboard
Blogs, eCommerce websites, pages under construction. Regardless of the site type, we all want the fastest way to access Custom Post Types (e.g. Posts, Pages, Products), to view, edit or get specific info. This is the tool you need to speed your work up!

Your time is precious, so wasting it with excessive steps in a simple process is something we want to avoid.
